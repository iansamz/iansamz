I'm a passionate full stack developer with extensive experience with both server side and
client side MVC frameworks. My development stack of choice includes Git, Angular/Vue/React with Server Side Rendering,
NestJs/Django for Backend Development, SASS,CSS3 and HTML5. I'm a firm believer in test driven development, continous 
integration and code review, and always strive to write beautiful and elegant code that solves
complex problems easily.
